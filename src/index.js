    *	When authoring custom element constructors, authors are bound by the following 
    *	conformance requirements:
    *
    *	- A parameter-less call to super() must be the first statement in the constructor
    *	  body, to establish the correct prototype chain and this value before any further
    *	  code is run.
    *
    *	- A return statement must not appear anywhere inside the constructor body, unless 
    *	  it is a simple early-return (return or return this).
    *
    *	- The constructor must not use the document.write() or document.open() methods.
    *
    *	- The element's attributes and children must not be inspected, as in the non-upgrade
    *	   case none will be present, and relying on upgrades makes the element less usable.
    *
    *	- The element must not gain any attributes or children, as this violates the 
    *	  expectations of consumers who use the createElement or createElementNS methods.
    *
    *	- In general, work should be deferred to connectedCallback as much as possibleâ€”especially
    *	  work involving fetching resources or rendering. However, note that connectedCallback
    *	  can be called more than once, so any initialization work that is truly one-time will
    *	  need a guard to prevent it from running twice.
    *
    *	- In general, the constructor should be used to set up initial state and default 
    *	  values, and to set up event listeners and possibly a shadow root.
